        Adopting a child will take atleast 6 months from the application
        to the finalization of the process in court. Some parts of the
        process include submitting an application, conducting a homestudy
        process, working with a caseworker for an appropriate match, meeting
        the child if match is found, applying for subsidy and completing
        legalization of adoption in court. For further detail on each part
        of the adopting process, look into
